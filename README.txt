# BankingSimpleApplicationJava
I am using this banking application program to learn Java, which allows a user to create a bank account, 
perform transactions such as depositing and withdrawing funds, check the balance, view the most recent transaction, and exit the program through a command-line interface.

**Identifies User:** The program creates a bank account with a user's name and ID.
   
**Displays Menu:** It shows a menu to the user with options like checking balance, depositing, withdrawing, viewing the previous transaction, and exiting.
   
**Performs Actions:** Based on user choice, it performs the selected operation.
   
**Shows Previous Transaction:** It lets the user see their last deposit or withdrawal.
   
**Exit:** The program ends when the user selects the 'Exit' option.
